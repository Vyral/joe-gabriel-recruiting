<p>Dear Real Estate Agent, </p>

<p>I understand that you may be working at a real estate brokerage or on a traditional team as part of someone else’s personal brand. You understand your potential and are working hard to clear a path toward your goals, but currently lack the support you need to achieve them. </p>

<p>Many brokerages promise to provide structure, coaching, and other resources, but fail to make good on their word once they’ve drawn you in. As a result of this and other factors, <strong>87% of all new agents fail within five years of working in the industry.</strong> </p>

<p>Even the most hardworking agents won’t get anywhere if they don’t have enough support. Far too many new agents bury themselves in debt just trying to find a way to jumpstart their business. They invest all their time, money, and energy into dead-end resources that won’t actually help their career. With this in mind, it’s no wonder that the average agent in the United States only sells four homes a year—and many of these agents turn to big-box brokerages in hopes that doing so will turn their career around. Unfortunately, these massive real estate brands don’t care about the success of individual agents. </p>

<p>So, if working for a major brand isn’t the right way to find your footing in the industry, then what is? Well, I’m glad you asked…</p>

<p>My name is Lori Gabriel. I’m the broker-owner of Team Gabriel / Coldwell Banker, and I’ve got an offer for you. Having worked in real estate for more than 26 years, I’ve seen a lot of people in the same position you’re in right now. </p>

<p><strong>TEAM GABRIEL truly invests in its agents’ success. We offer: </strong>
<ul class="indent">
<li>Access to our full-time back-end support team</li>
<li>Consistent coaching from team leaders (including me, personally)</li>
<li>The ability to promote listings on an incredible number of real estate platforms</li>
<li>Access to proven, repeatable systems and CRMs</li>
<li>Abundant leads</li>
<li>Weekly in-person training for scripting, continued education, and more</li>
<li>Access to multiple marketing platforms </li>
<li>Access to high-tech marketing materials, like drone videography</li>
<li>And much, much more</li>
</ul></p>

<p>When you join us, your path to success starts right away. Your training begins on day one, as does your access to all of the benefits and resources I just mentioned—which, by the way, I pay for on your behalf. That’s right: These resources are free for you to use as an agent on our team. </p>

<p>Our support-oriented environment helps professionals learn, grow, and thrive. <strong>People join our team because they want to succeed, make money, and serve our community.</strong> We understand that to reach those goals, you need support, coaching, resources, and leads—so that is exactly what we provide. Our systems truly work. Beyond that, I am personally invested in your success. So much so that I promise to pay you $100 out of my own pocket if I ever miss a meeting with you once you join. I believe in my agents, and for good reason. </p>

<p>Our team has sold thousands of homes over the years, and we have extensive experience working with buyers and sellers of all kinds, including military families, first-time buyers, new construction properties, and more. And by learning from these experiences, many of our agents have doubled their income each year for the past three years straight. Even our newest agents see incredible results by plugging into our systems.</p>

<p>Take, for example, Jillian. Jillian was new to the industry and was having a hard time finding her footing. Everything changed when she came to us. She sold 26 homes in her first year on our team, and is now set to double that figure by the end of this year. </p>

<p>And then there’s Lauren—who joined our team without any prior experience. Lauren was able to double her income in her first year on our team, and, amazingly, did so again this year. </p>

<p>When you consider success stories like these, it’s clear that we know what it takes to help agents succeed in this industry. Now it’s time to write your own.</p>


<p>The choice is in your hands. You can stay struggling where you’re at, join a big box brokerage where you’ll get no support, or even quit the industry altogether and go get started working at a 9-to-5 job—or you can join Team Gabriel and start leading the life you deserve. <strong>We’re looking for a select group of positive, hardworking, full-time agents to join us, and that could very well include you.</strong> </p>

<p>Here’s my offer: <strong>Let’s meet and have a conversation so that, together, we can figure out if you’re the right fit for our team.</strong> We’re prepared to offer you the coaching, consulting, education with the industry’s greatest tools, systems, models, and leadership that will allow you to thrive.</p>

<p>We take agents and turn them into business professionals. We’re offering you success, very competitive compensation, and the ability to have a great balance between your life and your work. When you apply with us, you are taking advantage of the opportunity to truly fulfill your potential. </p>

<p>So what are you waiting for? This opportunity will only exist for a limited time, as we’ll only be hiring a handful of agents, so reach out today. We’ve got leads waiting for you. </p>

<p>I’m looking forward to talking to you soon!</p>
