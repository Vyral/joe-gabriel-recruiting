A real estate team is a group of agents who work together to generate leads, manage listings, and collect commission. **The real estate industry has a long reputation for being cutthroat, but it doesn't have to be that way.** Take our team, for example.

At Team Gabriel, you can always expect constant support, accountability, and training. We have agents and specialists. The specialists include the transaction coordinator, videographer, ISA, and an assistant ready to support all the agents on our team. An abundance of leads are provided to our agents, along with all the platforms they‘ll need to create a successful business. Everyone works together in a positive direction and reaps the benefits.

Why should you consider joining a real estate team? **Working alone can be very difficult, especially if you’re a new agent.** There’s a big learning curve when you first start, and it’s a much steeper curve when you’re doing everything on your own without support.

Learning from other agents is another huge advantage of working on a team. You can learn from listing specialists and buyer specialists. We also take care of our agents’ marketing efforts and share the costs so that these strategies are more cost-effective for you. Working with a team means that you walk into listing appointments with confidence.

Experienced agents know that **to make money, you need to be responsive.** On a team like ours, you’ll be able to spend more time with your family because we have the staff to handle things when you’re away from the office. If you’re working on your own, you have to be there every step of the way, which can take a toll on your relationships.

One of the biggest challenges with real estate is inconsistent income. We will teach you how to fill your pipeline so you can constantly have income and deals coming in. As a solo agent, you won’t have that luxury.

If you’re interested in joining a team like ours that will help you take your real estate career to the next level, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
