Interest rates are expected to increase two to three times minimum in 2022. The good news is that they’ll still be very low compared to what they’ve been historically. Though rates are rising, buyers are still out in full force.&nbsp;

**Don’t be afraid to buy a home**; if you’re considering it, it’s still a wonderful time. Take advantage of these low interest rates—they’ll give you much more buying power than you’ll have if you wait another year or two when they’ll likely be higher.&nbsp;
