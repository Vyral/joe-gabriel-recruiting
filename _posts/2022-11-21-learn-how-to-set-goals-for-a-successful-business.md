2023 is right around the corner—how are you with setting your business goals? **If you’re setting goals before the new year starts, the most important tip I can give you is to make sure you put it in writing.**

This way, you can refer back to it, and check in throughout the year. Many people sometimes hesitate writing goals down because it means they actually have to do it. By writing down that you want to earn $100,000 over the next 12 months, you have to figure out how to get there.

To get started, I suggest breaking down your activities. It all boils down to your transactions. From there, you can work backwards. Plan everything in terms of monthly, weekly and daily goals. Which activities do you need to do in order to accomplish your goals? You can actually decide how many conversations you need to have to get to an appointment, and then to a transaction.

The first thing you need to do is make several calls to get to conversations. When you get to those conversations, you get two appointments. When you get to the appointments, you get to the transactions. You can always work it backwards; if you know you want to make $100,000 for the year, you want to know what are your numbers? What daily numbers do you need to get to your goal?&nbsp;

When you put your goals down in writing, don't be afraid of them. They're your goals. It's your plan. You can change or improve them, and hopefully meet and exceed them, just like when you're playing with your schedule or doing time blocking.

**If you write down your goals, and you know what you want to do for the next 12 months, it will give you that energy and the drive to succeed.** If you'd like to talk more about goal setting or there's anything else that we can help you with, don't hesitate to reach out by giving us a call or sending an email.
