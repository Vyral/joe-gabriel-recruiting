Today I want to talk about how you can succeed as a new real estate agent. There are plenty of things that you should be doing as a new agent, like choosing a brokerage, creating a website, making sure everybody knows that you're a Realtor, setting up your database, and reaching out. However, those are just a few of the basics. I want to share with you some more tips to go above and beyond:

**1\. Set up a routine.** I firmly believe that this is the start of success. You don't have to plan out every second, but you should have a map of your day and know what you're going to do. That way, all the important things get done, and you can achieve the tasks that you know are important for that day. Don't be hard on yourself. Sometimes things don't go right, and that's okay. You'll work out the kinks as you get more experience. Stick to a schedule, thoughâ€”it definitely helps.

**2\. Master your market.** You should know everything about the details of your area. You should know the population, what schools are there, what local regulations are, restaurants, and entertainment, and you definitely want to know what homes are for sale. Practice looking at the multiple listing service and knowing your market.

**&nbsp;****3\. Take care of yourself.** You need to prepare that hard work is ahead. You have hustling, facing tough times, and situations that will come up. This is a new position for you, and it can sometimes be overwhelming. Don't run yourself dry. Set boundaries, set aside time for yourself, exercise, and spend time with family and friends. Take care of yourself.

**4\. Consider getting a mentor.** Someone like myself. This transaction can be very hard. It's not an easy industry, although many people think it is. While looking at houses is fun, there's much more to this game. Having a mentor to help you succeed and tell you what to do, guide you and help you with your activities, and keep you on the right track is very important.
