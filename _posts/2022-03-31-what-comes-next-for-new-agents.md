It’s very easy to get overwhelmed when you first join the real estate industry. There’s a big learning curve—you have to figure out so many different programs and applications over the days and weeks of your courses. However, at Team Gabriel, we have a list of onboarding activities that will give you a sense of direction once you’ve been licensed.

After you join a team or brokerage, the next thing we advise you to do is start creating a database. **Create a spreadsheet that includes a couple hundred names of people who know, like, and trust you,** such as your friends, family, work acquaintances, and social media connections. You should also include contact information like their phone numbers, physical addresses, and email addresses.

Once you’ve added everyone to your list, you’ll be able to start your database. This list is vital; with it, you can send out a letter to them all announcing your real estate career. After all, you don’t want to be a secret agent. Make sure that everyone on your contact list knows you’re ready to be their real estate resource.

We have a list of ideas on how and where to obtain names and contact information for your database. If you’d like a copy of that list or have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us by phone or email. We’re happy to help.
