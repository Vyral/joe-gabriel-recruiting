Today we want to share a testimonial from one of our agents, Tracy Heinz. She’s been a fantastic addition to our group, and she has a lot to say about the experience.

Tracy has been in real estate for 15 years, and **she’s a big believer that video is the future of the business.** She was spending countless hours in her office trying to figure things out when she stumbled across our team.

We already had the video portion of the business set up for our agents to take advantage of. **As Tracy found out, the rest of our business model works the same way.** She was impressed by our technology, tools, and positive attitude. Immediately, she noticed that her values aligned with ours.&nbsp;

Tracy has been part of many teams, but Team Gabriel is the first group she’s been a member of to follow through on our promises. She’s running around with tons of business every day, just the way she likes it. Plus, she’s planning on moving to Florida soon. Since we already have an established business down there, the transition should be much easier for her.&nbsp;

If you want to reach Tracy, give her a call at 860-926-5121. As always, if you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to call or email. We look forward to hearing from you\!
