<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here are agent Sharon’s experiences and why she joined our team.</em></p>

Sharon, an agent on our team, told us about her real estate experience and why she came to work for us:

“The reason I got into real estate was that I had two children and wanted a more flexible schedule. I wanted to be home for my newborn and when my son got off the school bus every day. However, the principal challenge when I began real estate was that I thought I would make my own schedule, but it turned out I was working morning, noon, night, and weekends, and trying to juggle family life.

**Real estate started getting exciting when I met people and helped them through every step of the process** of one of the largest investments of their lives. My motivation is wanting to help people, and I’m sticking with it now. Unfortunately, back in 2007 when the market crashed, I had to make the decision to go back to my previous job, healthcare management. However, once the market began to recover, I was ready to get back into real estate. I loved working with people and helping them find the ideal home for their families.&nbsp;

Later, my family relocated to Connecticut, and I knew I wanted to continue working in real estate. Being new to the area, I knew that was going to be a challenge, so I wanted to join a team. When I came to meet Team Gabriel I saw they were easy to work with, down to earth, and it seemed like the perfect team for me. The training was great, it wasn’t hard to adjust to this new environment, they made it easy, and **I’m very happy to be a part of their team.**&nbsp;

Starting a career in real estate is a challenge, but as long as you have structure and routine, and you follow those, you’ll be successful.”
