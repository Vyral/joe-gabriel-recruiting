Today Kayla Zimmerman is sharing her experience of joining Team Gabriel and working with us:

**“I always knew I wanted to be a Realtor, I just didn’t know where to start.** When I found Team Gabriel, I applied to be an assistant, but when Lori and Joe interviewed me, they decided I would make a good Realtor. I joined the team in August 2020 during the pandemic. They were very supportive, and I was excited to jump right into being a real estate agent because that was my ultimate goal.

They walked me through all the steps of how to get my license and got me settled into the job of a Realtor. I got my license for Connecticut and Massachusetts and love my job. Team Gabriel was very helpful with everything I needed, and I love the daily support we get; they’re always there to answer questions or help with any challenges we face. **They’re there to help us reach our goals, cheer us on, and congratulate us when we succeed.&nbsp;**

So far this year I’ve sold 15 houses, which wouldn’t have been possible on any other team. I wouldn’t be where I am today without Team Gabriel. If you’re considering becoming a Realtor, I 100% recommend working with them.”

If you have any questions or would like to hear more about joining our team, call or email us. We would love to speak with you.
